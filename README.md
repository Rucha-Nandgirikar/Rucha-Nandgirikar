## 🤖 Transition to AI Engineering

I’ve intentionally transitioned into **AI Engineering** by designing and shipping **production-oriented AI projects**, including:

* **RAG systems** using modern LLM frameworks, embeddings, vector databases, and caching layers
* **AI agents** integrated into real workflows and deployed on cloud platforms
* **LLM-powered browser extensions** for automation and productivity
* **Voice-enabled AI agents** built using serverless and cloud-native architectures

All AI work is **hands-on, project-driven, and open-sourced** in my GitHub repositories.

* Some of my AI engineering work can be found in these repositories:

* Rapid Apply — LLM-powered Chrome extension with RAG for job application automation (https://github.com/Rucha-Nandgirikar/jobSync.ai)
* Repair Booking Agent — Voice-enabled AI agent built on AWS using Bedrock (https://github.com/Rucha-Nandgirikar/appliance_appointment_booking_assistant)
* Voice AI Study Companion — Voice-first, adaptive AI tutor for the web. (https://github.com/Rucha-Nandgirikar/voice_ai_study_companion)
* StatFlow — Natural-language data analysis using MCP tools and LLMs (https://github.com/Rucha-Nandgirikar/statflow)
